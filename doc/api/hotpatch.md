at a later stage, such as callbacks or event handlers can however be changed and
tested on the fly.

## EXAMPLES

Hot patch scripts with aliases

```js
var amok = require('amok');

var runner = amok.createRunner();
runner.set('scripts', {
  'alias': 'real-path.js':
});

runner.use(amok.hotpatch());
runner.connect(9922, 'localhost', function(error) {
  if (error) {
    return console.error(error);
  }

  console.log('Hot patching runner scripts');
});
```

Subscribe to script changes in a browser target

```js
window.addEventListener('scriptChange', function(event) {
  console.log('script %s changed', event.detail.filename);
});
```
